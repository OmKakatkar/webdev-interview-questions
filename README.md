# React + TypeScript Interview Questions

A curated, growing repository of real-world technical interview questions and detailed solutions, organized by framework & programming language.

## 🗂 Structure

- Each main folder (such as `react-questions`) contains markdown files, one per interview question.
- Questions will be grouped by technology—add more folders like `angular-questions`, `javascript-questions`, or `node-questions` as the collection grows.

## 📄 Contents

- Practical coding interview problems
- Step-by-step explanations and multiple approaches (brute force to optimized)
- Code samples, complexity analysis, and interviewer tips
- No compiled code or dependencies—just markdown for easy reading & sharing

## 🚀 Getting Started

Simply browse folders and open `.md` files for each question and its detailed breakdown.  
No installation or setup required!

## 📝 How to Contribute

- Add or improve questions by opening a PR.
- Organize new questions in relevant framework/language folders.
